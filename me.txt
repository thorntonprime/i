    zhou's political view seems pretty clear:
      this is making laws and breaking up obstacles

    i prefer take a more expansive view
    that this is about 


      ䷺ y62 w59
        [siu] overcoming dissension
        [huang] dispersing
        [karcher] dispersing / gushing

      ䷻ y23 w60
        [siu] regulations
        [huang] restricting
        [karcher] articulating the crossings


So again, divergent views --
Huang seeing pulling something out of the dirt,
and Karcher with something being divided in two or separated.
