i love that the stranger than fiction cover
shows a black hole falling on Harold Crick

he is heavier than a black hole
he is where causality reaches its limit

the emptiness left behind
is an enso

together

they look like a white bead and a black bead
below, dressed in a blue suit
he looks almost like a smudge between
white and clear and blue

it is hard not to see things this way
where i am the center of existence

but the obvious conclusion is
that i am not, cannot be
because i am finite

and there must be You
infinite

and so all the coincidences in my life
spell only Your name
