this is brilliant corners

it is, of course, a tribute to thelonius monk

it is also how
life sometimes turns corners

and when i allow myself to wander
to flow freely into the natural corners and grooves
how i can find joy in these spaces

        [siu] arresting of decay
        [huang] remedying
        [karcher] corruption and pestilence / renovating
        [lynn] ills to be cured

        the hexagram is that of wind under mountain

        the ideogram is that of a bowl
        filled with worms

        other translations are
        [wilhelm] work on what has been spoiled
        [blofield] decay
        and huang lists others as
          poison, destruction, or corruption

        i see two ways to understand this:

        first, is the futility of wind
        blowing against a mountain
        it is the struggle of sisyphus

        the second is as something rotting
        demanding our attention

        though there might be a third
        in which this bowl of worms
        is a bowl of silkworms
        (or maybe a delicacy, like eels?)
        or some other advantageous thing
        to have

        this third reading might best coincide with
        zhou, who is translated by zhuang, saying

        [99402b49]
          remedying

          sublimely prosperous and smooth

          favorable to cross great rivers

          before starting, three days
          after starting, three days

        which huang notes,

          if {this gram} is "decay", "poison",
          "destruction", or "corruption",
          how can {it} deserve
          the most auspicious labels of
          prosperity and smoothness
          and be favorable to cross
          great rivers?

        he also quotes zhong

          the world will be regulated
          in good order

          it is favorable
          to cross great rivers

          it is time to go forward
          and do something

          it indicates that every ending
          follows a new beginning

          this is the course of Heaven

        to which huang concludes,

          obviously {this gram} bears the meaning
          of turning over a new leaf
          and making a fresh start

          on this ground
          i adopt remedying

        all of which i find
        a compelling rationale

        the hexagram is that of lake (or joy) over thunder (or movement)

        the ideogram is that of a
