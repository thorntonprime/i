☰

          the journey of a thousand miles
          starts with one step

  {suspense and humor are
  that the narrator knows what the character does not}

what was that?
  asks pooh

  "nothing", i say
  "nothing, pooh"

䷌>䷽

well, sometimes the smallest things
take up the most room in your heart

  "yes, pooh"
  i say

  back to the story

  the adventures of
  winnie the pooh

  by a. a. milne
who?

  "christopher's father
  you know that pooh"

oh, yes

  now, back to the book
  a. a. milne has dedicated the book

  to Her
  and he says,

    hand in hand we come
    christopher robin and i

    to lay this book in your lap

    say you're surprised?
    say you like it?

    say it's just wehat you wanted?

                because it's yours --

  "i think it says,
  BATH MAT"

  pooh may
  have dyslexia

  but that doesn't matter
  because bears don't need to read everything right

  only enough
  to know which jars have honey

indeed
  pooh agrees

  CHAPTER ONE

  in which

  we are introduced to winnie the pooh
  and some bees
  and the stories begin

---

  here is edward bear
  coming downstairs now

  bump
  bump
  bump

  on the back of his head
  behind christopher robin

  it is
  as far as he knows

  the only way of coming downstairs
  but sometimes he feels

  that there really is
  another way

yes!
  pooh exclaims

why must the bear bump his head so
just to come downstairs

for honey
on toast?

  i'm sure christopher robin
  didn't mean it
