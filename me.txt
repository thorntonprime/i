  [oliver]
    Two or three times in my life I discovered love.
    Each time it seemed to solve everything.
    Each time it solved a great many things
        but not everything.
    Yet left me as grateful as if it had indeed, and
    thoroughly, solved everything.

    God, rest in my heart
    and fortify me,
    take away my hunger for answers,
    let the hours play upon my body

    like the hands of my beloved.
    Let the cathead appear again—
    the smallest of your mysteries,
    some wild cousin of my own blood probably—
    some cousin of my own wild blood probably,
    in the black dinner-bowl of the pond.

    7.

    After the rain, I went back into the field of sunflowers.
    It was cool, and I was anything but drowsy.
    I walked slowly, and listened

    to the crazy roots, in the drenched earth, laughing and growing.
