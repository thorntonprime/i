?

  "i think it says,
  BATH MAT"

  pooh may
  have dyslexia

  but that doesn't matter
  because bears don't need to read everything right

  only enough
  to know which jars have honey

indeed
  pooh agrees

  CHAPTER ONE

  in which

  we are introduced to winnie the pooh
  and some bees
  and the stories begin

---
  there is a picture of christopher
  coming down the stairs

  and he has his stuffed bear
  in one hand

  but we hear this story
  from the bear's perspective
---
  here is edward bear
  coming downstairs now

  bump

  bump

  bump

  on the back of his head
  behind christopher robin

  it is
  as far as he knows

  the only way of coming downstairs
  but sometimes he feels

  that there really is
  another way

---
yes!
  pooh exclaims

why must the bear bump his head so
just to come downstairs

for honey
on toast?

  i'm sure christopher robin
  didn't mean it
---

  if only he could stop bumping for a moment
  and think of it

  and then he feels that perhaps there isn't

  anyhow
  here he is at the bottom

  and ready to be introducted to you

  winnie-the-pooh

  when i first heard his name
  i said

  just as you are going to say
          "but i thought he was a boy"

    "so did i"
  said christopher robin

    "then you don't call him winnie?"
  "i don't"

    "but you said --
    they's Winnie-THEY-Pooh
  
    "don't you know
    what 'they' means?"
---
  christopher had learned all about
  how some people want to be called THEY at school

  christopher's teacher said
  it was always polite to use the names people like to be called

  and not make up stupid
  or mean names for them
---
  "ah, yes, now i do"
  i say quickly

  and i hope you do too
  because it is all the explanation you are going to get
---
  but you are right
  winnie likes to be called

  "winnie THEY pooh"
  and when we talk about things that belong to winnie-they-pooh

  we say "winnie THEIR pooh"
  and so that is what we shall call winnie-they-pooh

  so, anyway,
---
  sometimes  winnie-they-pooh
  likes a game of sort

  when they come downstairs
  and sometimes they like to sit quitely

  in front of the fire
  and listen to a story

  this evening --
    "what about a story", asks christopher robin

  "what about a story?"
  i say

    "could you very sweetly tell
    winnie-they-pooh one?"

  "i suppose i could", i say
  "what sort of stories do they like?"


    "about themself
    because they are *that* sort of Bear"

  "oh, i see"
    "so could you very sweetly?"

  "i will try"
  i say

  so i try
