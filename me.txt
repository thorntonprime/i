      ䷸ w57
        [siu] gentle penetration
        [huang] subtle
    
      ䷹ w58
        [siu] joy
        [huang] joyful

the meaning is a obvious
once you hear huang's description of the ideograph:

  The ideograph uses the image of
  a person singing and dancing
  to express the mood of joy.
  It consists of three parts.
  In the middle is
  an open mouth singing.
  The lower part is made up of
  two legs
  which seem to be
  moving and dancing.
  The upper part depicts
  two arms swinging in the air,
  expressing joy.

i think the only other way this can be interpreted is
as someone holding their hands to their face in sheer excitement and joy
