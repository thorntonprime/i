  in the story
  the boy remembers

  he remembers
  he was seven or eight

  he was alone with his mother
  probably driving somewhere in the car

  she was annoyed or distracted
  he couldn't tell

  did he want her attention?
  is that why he said

sometimes i hear
talking in my head

  she freaks out
  she pulls over

  it is raining
  that was dangerous

this must be serious
  he thinks

  of course later he remembers
  that his parents would joke

  about how he talked to himself
  as a child

  he was of course
  just talking to the person

  telling this story
  is that so strange?

  because his whole childhood
  people would read him stories

  so was it strange that there was one
  telling the story of his life as it happened?

  anyway, his mother freaks,
    "do you need to talk to a priest?"

  he shrinks, afraid of
  being alone with the priest gave him the creeps

  it is safe in sunday school
  because there is a line

you have to get out
he has to let you out to let the next kid in

that isn't as bad
  he tells himself

when they have to let you out
because the next one is waiting

  "don't worry", i tell him
  "tell her you don't have a voice in your head"

  she thinks you are crazy
  or possessed by a demon

  "it's okay if you lie to her"
  the voice says

  when he's an adult
  he will know he can't be crazy

  the voice isn't his
  it is just someone reading his story

"no! i was just saying
what if i heard voices in my head?"

  he lies
  she accepts his lie

  she doesn't want to think about
  a possessed and schizophrenic son

  let's review the symptoms
  though

    * hallucinations

  he has never seen anything
  that he can't explain with science

in fact everything i see usually has a simple explanation
  he adds

    * delusions

  he has strong beliefs
  and they may seem eccentric to others

  but are they irrational?
they don't seem to me to be irrational

in fact 
i find i can out-logic most people

it is a game i learned
i like to call smarty-pants

  "yes, you are good at that game,
  but it's only a game"

i know
  he says, embarrassed by his own pride

    * thought disorder

  his thoughts are jumbled
  and he has had to come to novel ways

  to organize them
quite literally

  "yes, quite literally"
  he beamed with pride with the recognition
