        [huang] traveling

        the ideogram is that of a person on the left
        their arms are in the air as if they are dancing

        or making some other extreme gesture
        or maybe fleeing wildly

        huang says it is an outsider, a minority,
          "minority groups usually performed

          a dance ceremony before fighting"
        he then sees the figures on the right

        as two warriors, crouching, led by a third
        in a hunt     

        but it is hard not to see a resmblance
        of a "hangar" on the right

        with the same hangar found supporting a garment
        in "bringing together" [y30,w45]

        over the bowed figures
        of "union" [y20,w8]

        and one then wonders if the dancing warrior
        resembles more the figure of "joyful" [y33,w58]

        instead of the dancing warriors with weapons overhead
        in "following" [y31,w17]
      ䷶ w55

    ䷽ w62

      the pictograph is of lines
      depicting things being separated

      along with a pictograph of steps
      and a stop

      next to a house with a beam (or heavy tool?)
      over a house with a single mouth (or voice) inside
