䷓ pay attention
  ䷽ unafraid and curious in the little things
  ䷭ that grow, that strive

䷏ be astonished
    as a child before a troop of elephants
  ䷎ be humbled
    as one who faces the Game for the first time

䷒ tell about it
  ䷽ unafraid and curious in the little things
  ䷬ weaving these things into the fabric of your being
  
  and
䷛ to the furthest boundaries of existence
