      [siu] sincerity
      [huang] innermost sincerity
      [zeppelin]
        it isn't hard to feel me glowing
        i watched the fire that grew so low, oh
        it is the summer of my smiles
        flee from me, keepers of the gloom
        speak to me only with your eyes
        it is to you, i give this tune
        ain't so hard to recognize, oh
        these things are clear to all from time to time, ooh

      so truth, honesty

        [siu] gentle penetration
        [huang] proceeding humbly
        [karcher] subtle penetration / spreading the fates
        [zeppelin]
          it is the springtime of my loving
          the second season i am to know

        something touching, moving in a subtle way

      ䷹ w58
        [siu] joy
        [huang] joyful
        [karcher] open / expression
        [zeppelin]
          You are the sunlight in my growing
          so little warmth i've felt before

        joyful

        in the door's people are strange,
        being strange is another way of saying "high"
        and there is a joy in this
        anonymity and presence

    touching, joyful
    and honest
