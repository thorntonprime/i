      [zeppelin]
        It isn't hard to feel me glowing
        I watched the fire that grew so low, oh
        It is the summer of my smiles
        Flee from me, keepers of the gloom
        Speak to me only with your eyes
        It is to you, I give this tune
        Ain't so hard to recognize, oh
        These things are clear to all from time to time, ooh

      so truth, honesty

      Mmm, she's a little messiah, jewel in the crown
      Walking on water, cruising through fire
      It's shady weather, there's fear in the house
      Gotta come up on the pressure, gotta, gotta get up to get out

      I am feeling free, do not get to decide
      If I want to watch, if I want to lose control
      If I can please myself, if I can roll solo
      And when I play hard the softness starts to show in my bones
