    ䷼ y63 w61
      [siu] sincerity
      [huang] innermost sincerity
      [karcher] centering and connecting to the spirits

two things that prevent isomorphism:

  ䷼ those that are non-injective
    those that abstract -- multiple values collapse into a single value, the domain is larger than the co-domain
  ䷽ those that are non-surjective
    those that model -- where the domain (abnd subsequent image) is smaller than the co-domain

and any mporphism that is both monic (injective) and epic (surjective)
is isomorphic
