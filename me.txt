last night i saw a movie
which i was afraid would be sad sentimental garbage

instead it had two background characters
i found so particularly amusing

the first was the sister-in-law

who proudly displayed her tattoo she got from India
only to realize when she is told
that it doesn't say "inner peace"
and that it says instead "white girl"

  she confessed to her sister-in-law's fiance
  (who i love in his role as 'revealer of Truths')

"that's true. that's me"

  this self-knowledge
  was startling, but ultimately liberating

  the next character of remark is the niece
  daughter of the "white girl" sister-in-law

  her ears were covered
  keeping her from the obscene language

  so she watched in silence
  as her auntie's friend unmasked the fiend pretending to be Santa

  she wonders,
wasn't that the crazy man that
grannie kept hoping auntie would love?

auntie's friend
saved Christmas!

  and then she remembers,
he was the one that made
all that noise during my solo

and he saved me
because i was so scared

and because people were afraid of grannie
so i had to sing all alone

  and she was amazed
  and she was curious

  how could this strange man
  have saved things for her twice?

  and when auntie realized how much she loved
  the strange man

  and she said "no" to grannie
  
  grannie became a superhero of good
  and drove auntie and everybody to the airport

  and everybody lived happily ever after
  and Chirstmas became fun instead of work
