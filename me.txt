Huang describes the image as that of hands,
breaking up ice in a flowing stream.
Karcher's description suggests something more
akin to a person searching a cave in the dark,
or underwater
while passing something -- a knife? a jewel? a torch? --
from hand to hand.

When i look at the image, though,
i see hands letting a bird go free.
