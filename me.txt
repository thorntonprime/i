  magritte [said](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Son_of_Man)

at least it hides the face
partly well

so you have
the apparent face

the apple

hiding the visible
but hidden

the face
of the person

it's something
that happens constantly

everything we see
hides another thing

we always want to see
what is hidden by what we see

there is an interest
in that which is hidden

and which the visible
does not show us

this interest
can take the form of a quite intense feeling

a sort of conflict
  one might say

between the visible that is hidden
and the visible that is present

  of course
  he said nothing of the concrete wall

  the ocean
  the clouds

  the sky and empty space
  beyond

  hidden by the painting
  by this reality i watch
