an anti-blog
of game scores
and other random thoughts

my name
is thornton prime

this is a sort of "hobby" i have

see, i live most of my time
in a library of all the most fabulous books i can find

i don't believe in magic
or god who tells us to do this and not that

i don't believe in ghosts
or aliens inside of ufos

well
the best i can say

is that i haven't seen anything like that
for myself

and too many times
i see people using stories to hide from the Truth

and that never ends well
in the stories that i like

because there are some stories i love

and i strongly believe
in stories that enrich my experience

enrich other people too

so this hobby is to read
old stories that i like and admire

and "translate" them
into this imaginary language made using glass beads

and as i read these stories
written by other people

and as i translate them
i look for special meaning to these stories

and try to connect these stories
to people around me

because i hope that these stories
can say things to them

the vivid life that the stories
seem to speak to me

  knowing, of course,
  that people are enriched from these stories in DIFFERENT WAYS

  it would be boring
  if everyone saw the same thing

  no
because what is curious and strange

about reality
is that we see it through different prisms of experience

and we can only learn the whole truth
by listening, honestly and intently

to stories that resonate
like these do for me
