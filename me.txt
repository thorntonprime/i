i remember

yesterday at the dress shop
they need a deposit

they don't take credit cards
so we need to get cash

we forgot to take out cash
so we need to find an atm

the closest one is down the street
about two hundred meters

i am already nervous about
carrying around a lot of cash

i accompany srithip
down the street

past the expressway off ramp
over the small canal

a lot of smells
shit in the middle

of a narrow sidewalk
as cars and motorbikes

whizzing
by

we pass a strange kiosk
not an atm -- it makes me more apprehensive

finally the atm
a group of strange men on motorbikes

at the nearby corner
i am afraid of getting robbed

srithip starts the transaction
but we both forgot our debit cards at the hotel

the atm won't take
our credit cards

defeated
we are about to leave

the atm reports
  transaction has timed out

and a strange card spits out
i take it

  leave it
srithip says

we aren't even sure of
what kind of card it is

"i don't want someone to steal it"
  "what will you do with it?"

"give it to the shop
  or maybe turn it in at the hotel?"

we shrug
and return to the dress shop

defeated

back past the shit
on the sidewalk

back past the stinking canal
on the narrow sidewalk

beside the motorbikes
coming off the expressway

  "i'll take out cash"
luke says when we return

i accompany him back
past the canal

on the narrow sidewalk
"watch out"

past the shit
we reach the atm

luke performs the transaction
and as soon as he has cash in hand

a motorbike comes to an abrupt stop
a woman jumps off the back of the motorbike

i've heard of this sort of robbery
where one motorbike is a distraction

and someone else comes from the other side
grabs cash, jumps on the bike never to be seen again

she approaches luke
while the motorbike driver remains ready, helmet on

she says something
i can't understand

luke motions to her
  "no"

she asks again
i step between her and luke's cash

maybe she is begging for cash
i think

i have a few coins in my pocket
i offer them to her

  "no ... card"
i hand her the card

we walk
back

what are the odds that i would take her card
to keep it safe

then i would have to return
a few minutes later

with a different companion
to the same spot?

how could this not be a strange coincidence
of our bad luck

where we didn't have cash for the deposit
and needed to make two trips

and i would take her card
and return it?

it seems
unlikely

on the way back
a woman in the street

struggles with a cart
piled with cans and bottles for recycling

her old three-wheeled cart
has one wheel stuck in a sewer grate

she is holding up traffic
at the busy intersection

at the entrance to
the expressway

but i don't help her
no one does

she eventually gets it free
and traffic flows clear once again

why did i
not help her?
