      [siu] overcoming dissension
      [huang] dispersing

Huang describes the image of [w59] as that of hands,
breaking up ice in a flowing stream.
He interprets the sign as "Dispersing".

Karcher's description suggests something more
akin to a person searching a cave in the dark,
with something -- a knife or a stick.
He interpets the sign as "Dispersing / Gushing."

When i look at the image, though,
i see hands letting a small bird, or maybe a dragon-fly or butterfly go free,
and the flowing water suggests rapid movement.

In any case, we have two divergient views --
Karcher with something akin to pushing around in the dirt -- searching intently,
to Huang and Prime with something more like breaking up or letting go.

No surprise, then that Zhou pairs this with

    ䷻ y23 w60
      [siu] regulations
      [huang] restricting
      [karcher] articulating the crossings

Huang translates this as "restricting"
and Karcher as "articulating the crossings".
Huang sees in the image a sprout with a hand
cutting, suggesting an early harvest
or cutting something off before its prime.
Karcher sees a "person kneeling before a pot
of food {and} two bamboo segments or nodes."
This might mean some meal in two parts.

So again, divergent views --
Huang seeing pulling something out of the dirt,
and Karcher with something being divided in two or separated.
