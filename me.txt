  in the story
  the boy remembers

  he remembers
  he was seven or eight

  he was alone with his mother
  probably driving somewhere in the car

  she was annoyed or distracted
  he couldn't tell

  did he want her attention?
  is that why he said

sometimes i hear
talking in my head

  she freaks out
  she pulls over

  it is raining
  that was dangerous

this must be serious
  he thinks

  of course later he remembers
  that his parents would joke

  about how he talked to himself
  as a child

  he was of course
  just talking to the person

  telling this story
  is that so strange?

  because his whole childhood
  people would read him stories

  so was it strange that there was one
  telling the story of his life as it happened?

  anyway, his mother freaks,
    "do you need to talk to a priest?"

  he shrinks, afraid of
  being alone with the priest gave him the creeps

  it is safe in sunday school
  because there is a line

you have to get out
he has to let you out to let the next kid in

that isn't as bad
  he tells himself

when they have to let you out
because the next one is waiting

  "don't worry", i tell him
  "tell her you don't have a voice in your head"

  she thinks you are crazy
  or possessed by a demon

  "it's okay if you lie to her"
  the voice says

  when he's an adult
  he will know he can't be crazy

  the voice isn't his
  it is just someone reading his story

"no! i was just saying
what if i heard voices in my head?"

  he lies
  she accepts his lie

  she doesn't want to think about
  a possessed and schizophrenic son

  let's review the symptoms
  though

    * hallucinations

  he has never seen anything
  that he can't explain with science

in fact everything i see usually has a simple explanation
  he adds

    * delusions

  he has strong beliefs
  and they may seem eccentric to others

  but are they irrational?
they don't seem to me to be irrational

in fact 
i find i can out-logic most people

it is a game i learned
i like to call smarty-pants

  "yes, you are good at that game,
  but it's only a game"

i know
  he says, embarrassed by his own pride

    ? thought disorder

  his thoughts are jumbled
  and he has had to come to novel ways

  to organize them
quite literally

  "yes, quite literally"
  he beams with pride with the recognition

    ✓ thought disorder
  we should get that looked out

yes
  he agrees

    * movement disorder
hrmm ...

  he ponders this
  he had always thought that he had

    "essential tremors"
  is what the doctor had described to his mother

  it made sense that he had
  a genetic "essential tremor"

but it could be
a psychotic symptom

  "yes, it could
  we should mark that a maybe"

    ? movement disorder

  let's review some negative symptoms

    * having trouble planning and sticking with activities
    * having trouble anticipating and feeling pleasure
    * talking in a dull voice and showing limited facial expression
    * avoiding social interaction or interacting in socially awkward ways
    * having low energy and spending a lot of time in passive activities

  those are troubling
  because they seem to describe him accurately

yes
  he agrees again

    cognitive symptoms
    include

    * having trouble processing information
      to make decisions

i am rather proud
of how i process information

  and he does indeed
  make decisions rather decisively

of course i need time to process facts sometimes
  "of course", i respond

but i try to be reasonable
and limit my own deliberations when i know others depend on a decision

  "i agree"

  this is strangely -- in fact almost opposite --
  to what he experiences, or at least percieves

    * having trouble using information immediately after learning it

*ha!*
  he laughs out loud

  this is indeed laughable
  because this very activity

  that reveals the naked truth about him
  also shows immediate use of information

  it is a sort of hyper-learning
  the way he reads something

  and immediately associates it
  to some tangible, material thing in his life

  he just needs to be clear
  that this self-centered sort of gazing

  is just a funhouse mirror
  and that there is something behind the man with the apple

i know that
  more pride, but it can be a little endearing

  the way he clings
  to learning from everything this way

  strange, eccentric
  though

  now, the last cognitive symptom
    * having trouble focusing or paying attention

  he pauses
  this is a puzzling one

  maybe he should sit and stare at empty space
  for an hour or two

  to ponder this symptom
