      ䷹ w58
        [siu] joy
        [huang] joyful
        [karcher] open / expression

the meaning is a obvious
once you hear huang's description of the ideograph:

  The ideograph uses the image of
  a person singing and dancing
  to express the mood of joy.
  It consists of three parts.
  In the middle is
  an open mouth singing.
  The lower part is made up of
  two legs
  which seem to be
  moving and dancing.
  The upper part depicts
  two arms swinging in the air,
  expressing joy.

i think the only other way this can be interpreted is
as someone holding their hands to their face in sheer excitement and joy

karcher suggests it is a dancer or artist
and the image invokes that of
what one imagines the ancient Chinese practicing what we might call
spirit channeling,
with their mouth open and facing up into the sky.

is their a difference between artist, dancer,
and spirit channeller?

in all cases we have someone in an experience of ecstasy

i see [tadlock](https://youtu.be/1gKl-mwMyck?si=0FkXjZTUyaOZ14Ae)
dancing in her dream of tomorrow ...

it is, i imagine the feeling of continuous discovery
