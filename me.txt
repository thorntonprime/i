  occasionally he wonders to himself
what if i knew

that the watch was going
to save my life?

would i keep it
with me?

or is it more important
for the story

for me to keep
dreaming?

  winnie ponders such deep questions
  as he sits on a log

  outside his hole
  in the trunk of a tree

  there is a bell on a string

you're braver than you believe
stronger than you seem
and smarter than you think

  winnie would tell himself
  and it was true

  and winnie was always curious
  because he knew
  
sometimes the smallest things
take up the most room in your heart

and one shouldn't make a fuss
of things -- unless one is playing for fun

and everyone is in together
on the fun game

  winnie-the-pooh
  lived in a forest

  all by himself
  under the name of sanders

what does 'under the name' mean?
  asked christopher robin._

  it means he had the name over the door
  in gold letters, and lived under it

winnie-the-pooh wasn't quite sure?
  asked christopher robin

"now
i am"

  says a 
  growly voice

  "then i will go on"
  i say
