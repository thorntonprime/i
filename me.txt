Huang describes the image as that of hands,
breaking up ice in a flowing stream.
He interprets the sign as "Dispersing".

Karcher's description suggests something more
akin to a person searching a cave in the dark,
with something -- a knife or a stick.
He interpets the sign as "Dispersing / Gushing."

When i look at the image, though,
i see hands letting a baby dragon go free,
and the flowing water suggests rapid movement.
