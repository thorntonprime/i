    ䷼ y63 w61
      [siu] sincerity
      [huang] innermost sincerity

    zhou pairs this with y14 w62, [siu]"small gains"
    or [huang]"little exceeding"

the hexagram looks like an opening
it is an honesty from deep inside

  6b6 ䷼>䷸ y(63>66) w(61>57/58)

      ䷸ w57
        [siu] gentle penetration
        [huang] proceeding humbly
        [karcher] subtle penetration / spreading the fates

the image here is of an altar
possibly with two candles burning down

together

      ䷹ w58
        [siu] joy
        [huang] joyful
        [karcher] open / expression

the foundational trigrams here are the same
two -- symmetrically situated -- archetypes
that of double-joy and double-wind

  one is a light feather of a feeling
  and the other is that floating away

this reminds me of one of my favorite quotes,

  [zhuang](75c7fa03-d5ab-4b3f-b31f-0c3b7c9aead3)
  good fortune
  is light as a feather

    but nobody knows
    how to hold it up

  misfortune
  is heavy as the earth {or a landslide?}

    but nobody knows
    how to stay out of its way

          this is the same zhuang who dreams he is a butterfly
          and declares his experience "the transformation of things"

i guess it was his "aha!" moment
like paul's experience when he fell off the horse on the road

it's that moment in life that You realize
there is no turning back
                          but that the Way forward is joyful
