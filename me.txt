two things that prevent isomorphism:

  ䷼ those that are non-injective
    those that abstract -- multiple values collapse into a single value, the domain is larger than the co-domain
  ䷽ those that are non-surjective
    those that model -- where the domain (abnd subsequent image) is smaller than the co-domain

and any morphism that is both monic (injective) and epic (surjective)
is isomorphic

i'm reflecting on some wise words on awareness
by Chuck Hamilton
and a reflecting on a shared reflection with stephanie and susan
in which susan quoted blake:

  [9bccecdb]
  tyger tyger, burning bright,
  in the forests of the night;
  what immortal hand or eye,
  could frame thy fearful symmetry?
