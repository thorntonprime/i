why did it take me so long
to realize that the canvas shrinks
where ink dries?

that this wrinkling of the surface, this skin
like a topological deformation
a transformation

twists reality
like a four-dimensional möbius strip
the heart of a spinning black hole

a doughnut
a torus whose exterior surface is it's own interior
spinning such that it's future is it's own past
