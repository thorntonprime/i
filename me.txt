    ䷼ y63 w61
      [siu] sincerity
      [huang] innermost sincerity

    zhou pairs this with y14 w62, [siu]"small gains"
    or [huang]"little exceeding"

the hexagram looks like an opening
it is an honesty from deep inside

  6b6 ䷼>䷸ y(63>66) w(61>57/58)

      ䷸ w57
        [siu] gentle penetration
        [huang] proceeding humbly
        [karcher] subtle penetration / spreading the fates

      ䷹ w58
        [siu] joy
        [huang] joyful
        [karcher] open / expression

the foundational trigrams here are the same
two -- symetrically situated -- archetypes
that of double-joy and double-wind

one is a light feather of a feeling
and the other is that floating away

this reminds me of one of my favorite quotes,

  [zhuang](75c7fa03-d5ab-4b3f-b31f-0c3b7c9aead3)
  good fortune
  is light as a feather

    but nobody knows
    how to hold it up

  misfortune
  is heavy as the earth {or a landslide?}

    but nobody knows
    how to stay out of its way
