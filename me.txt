䷓ pay attention
䷏ be astonished
䷒ tell about it

excellent advice -- of course -- for writers

and more generally people

i'd adapt her recommendation to

䷓ pay attention
  ䷽ unafraid and curious in the little things
  ䷭ that grow, that strive

䷏ be astonished
    as a child before a troop of elephants
  ䷎ be humbled
    as one who faces the Game for the first time

䷒ tell about it
  ䷽ unafraid and curious in the little things
  ䷬ weaving these things into the fabric of your being
  
  and

䷛ to the furthest boundaries of existence
---
some things are not that peculiar
when You realize
in the vastness of the universe
how many times it must happen
