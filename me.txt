butterfly, dance across the sky to me
come and spend some time with me

i promise not to pin you down
or even frown

if you have to fly away
into someone else's dream

come and spend some time with me
linger just a little while – butterfly style

before you flitter away
i used to think that butterflies were meant for catchin'

'til the time i caught one in my net
took it home and tried to make it happy

but the very next day (the very next day)
the next day it was dead

butterfly i buried in the meadow
where i'd found it flying so free

after that i learned my lesson
if you love a butterfly (if you love a butterfly)

if you love it let it be
if you love a butterfly (if you love a butterfly)

if you love a butterfly (if you love a butterfly)
if you love it let it be

butterfly, glad to see you back again
come and rest your wings my friend

i promise not to pin you down
or even frown

if you have to fly away
into someone else's dream

come and spend some time with me
linger just a little while – butterfly style

before you flitter away
before you flitter away

before you flitter away
before you flitter away
