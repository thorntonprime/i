there was a tv commercial some time ago
with alec baldwin as a substitute school teacher

he asks the class
what their teacher was teaching them

the kids say
  spelling

he says:
  spelling's not a class
  it's a program
  spell-check
 
some university professor
challenged about the lack of basic financial literacy
of college graduates
said that
knowing how to balance a checkbook
was as useless and antiquated a skill
as knowing how
to churn butter

he said
if you bank on your smart phone
as everybody does
your phone automatically does that
for you
 
were thomas watson to post his
  think!
signs today
everybody'd say
  “why? i've got an app for that.”
 
we are infected with
a disdain for the very act of thinking

the ability to figure things out is
increasingly
viewed as
irrelevant and unnecessary

people are stupid and proud of it
 
sure, we had cliff notes when i grew up
and i've yet to read moby dick in full
but at least i read the cliff notes
 
even picking lottery ticket numbers
is too much for people –
they let the computer
pick random numbers for them

folks with more money to lose
than the average lottery victim
buy stock market trading software
that flashes green lights
to tell them to buy
and red lights
to tell them to sell
 
people couldn't wait for
cars that drive themselves
 
we are in a mad rush
to become a population
incapable of thinking 
or doing
for itself

little birds
cozy in the nest
beaks open
waiting for somebody
to drop in a worm
 
but thinking is
all that distinguishes us
from those birds
or pigs
or, actually
tree stumps
 
if we won't think
soon we can't think
 
the extreme minority
that gets rich and stays rich
are still the thinkers
the schemers, the plotters
the information collectors
the creative figure-it-out'ers

the ones who can make
a fire with two sticks
and can find the sticks in the woods
without a gps

as there are
fewer
and fewer
such people

more and more
money
is moving into those
fewer and
fewer
hands
 
turn off
the things doing
your thinking for you

do money math on a pad
sound out a word and spell it

ponder small and
large questions

pull together
information

read
watch tv – but ask
  how can i use this?

use and strengthen your capacity to think

or lose it
