jesus said [luke@14.26]
  "anyone who does not HATE

  their father
  their mother

  their spouse
  their child

  their siblings
  friends and compatriots

    -- and even their own lives --
  such a person cannot follow me."

HATE

it is a pretty harsh word
and some translators have tried to soften it

to make it seem more compatible 
with "family values"

so they use the words "turn away" or "abandon"
or "love me more than" or

they add conditionals like
"by comparison"

but i think all that misses the point
jesus isn't easy to follow

he said that, he said
  "my yoke is heavy"

but how does a man of peace
come to advocate hate?

i don't think he does
i think he is saying

we need to reject the roles
that have been hoisted on us

the ones we were born with
the ones we stumbled into

and we need to examine them
carefully

and what doesn't work
we throw away [matt@5.30]

  "and if your right hand drags you into unhappiness
  throw it away

  it is better to lose one part
  than to lose your whole body and soul"

i think he was giving a specific lesson
on the toxicity of some burdens

and specifically the unnecessarily restrictive roles
people have taken

imagine the middle east --
  now in its third century of constant warfare --

only that children are no longer burdened
by the generational debts of their ancestors

people no longer feel compelled to act to avenge
their mother who died, their father who died, their child, their spouse, their friend

and instead of blaming a category of people
with stereotype and preconception and hatred

they -- accepting the deep sorrow of irreplaceable loss --
recognize that the person who murdered their loved one

was avenging the death
of their own loved one

lashing out in anger in hatred,
at those they have stereotyped and pre-judged

and that is what it is

  judgement

and i think jesus was trying to get people to accept
that we can hate these roles that we've created

hate the static relations that imply -- without ever being explicit -- obligations
that bind us to reactions

reactions that hurt, harm
injure, kill

and not hate the people

i think jesus said all this
though imprecisely, or at least it's been handed down imprecisely

so while thousands of years of translators
have attempted to reconcile jesus with "family values"

i am ready
to rethink "family values"

i think that relationships between people
are trust

and you earn trust
by keeping your word

but you also earn trust
by being honest with people

about how i have failed
and about how i need to change

how we need to change
because the world is constantly changing

and rather than clinging to some
unwritten rules that demand vengeance

or any other assumed response

we give ourselves
space to stop and ponder

to feel, without judgement
to act, without preconception or prejudice

we can hate labels
that imply some responsibility

and be explicit instead
and say instead

  "i love you
  and that means i trust you with the truth about me"

and then we share
those truths

and sometimes
people will reject us

because they aren't ready
or maybe because we aren't

  maybe the truth that we know
  is incomplete and flawed

  and the other person can sense it
  but can't precisely describe it

  and can't help us see
  the bigger truth of ourselves

  and that's okay

but in rejecting it should be enough to say
"i'm sorry, i can't be for you
 
what you seem to want
what you seem to need"
